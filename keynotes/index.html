          From Digital Twins to Generative Digital Twins: Towards a Novel
          Approach in the IoT Edge-Cloud Continuum
        </h3>
        <h5>Presented by: Dr. Giancarlo Fortino</h5>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Digital Twins (DTs) are software replicas that not only mirrors
          physical entities but can also proactively predict, control, optimize
          and simulate their behavior. Born in the manufacturing sector, this
          concept after an initial hype stayed untouched for decades. The rise
          of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled
          DT, respectively, to exchange real-world data and to fully exploit it
          for fulfilling its own goals. Very recently, Gener-ative AI (Gen-AI)
          methods started being sporadically applied to DT in different contexts
          and with different targets. In this talk, starting from our
          experiences on design, implementation and evaluation of DTs and, more
          recently, of Opportunistic DTs, we first provide a definition for the
          Generative DT (GDT) which embraces main distinctive aspects and
          potential of current and future Gen-Al-aided DTs.
          <br /><br />
          In particular, we disclose the role of Gen-AI in conciliating the
          model and the data-driven approach for the development of DTs. Then,
          we analyze the added value of main Gen-AI architectures for maximizing
          the performance of DTs operating in the IoT domain and deployed in the
          edge-cloud continuum.
          <br /><br />
          Finally, we illustrate the potential of a GDT in emblematic Smart City
          scenarios through a use case involving the prediction of vehicles'
          trajectories when, due to uncontrolled events, only partial
          information is accessible. The outlined solution conciliates accuracy
          and explainability in the trajectory prediction with overall system
          robustness and effectiveness.

          Intelligent Edge Sensing and Distributed Cognition Are Transforming
          the Future of Smart World
        </h3>
        <h5>Presented by: Dr. Runhe Huang</h5>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Intelligent edge sensing and distributed cognition are reshaping the
          architecture of future smart worlds. By enabling real-time perception,
          processing, and decision-making at the network edge, intelligent
          sensing technologies reduce latency, enhance privacy, and support
          context-aware adaptation. At the same time, distributed cognition,
          defined as the integration of sensing, learning, memory, and reasoning
          across decentralized systems, provides a powerful framework for
          creating scalable and resilient intelligent environments. This talk
          will explore key advances in edge sensing frameworks, lightweight AI
          models, and associative memory mechanisms that are driving this
          transformation. Real-world applications in intelligent city
          transportation, elderly healthcare, and sparse mobile crowdsensing
          will be presented, highlighting how intelligent edge sensing and
          distributed cognition enable more responsive, efficient, and
          human-centric systems. Finally, future directions toward
          energy-efficient cognitive ecosystems and ethical considerations in
          distributed intelligence will also be discussed.
