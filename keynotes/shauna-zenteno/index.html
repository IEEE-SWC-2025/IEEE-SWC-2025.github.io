          Join us in exploring how inclusive leadership, creativity, and diverse
          perspectives are essential to harnessing AI and emerging technologies
          for a smarter, more equitable, and sustainable world
        </h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          We are at a time where significant advances in technology can be used
          to drive innovative solutions for complex global issues. On the
          journey to a smarter and sustainable future for everyone, the world
          has become more connected and advanced yet threatened by insecurity
          across multiple areas of society. The impacts of climate change,
          threats to human health, risks to food security, and increasing social
          inequities across populations are drivers for innovation. More
          technology-based solutions are being developed to address many of
          these issues, but how we develop and use them will determine our
          success. Development of technology is increasingly rapid, but
          magnitude of these issues leaves us increasingly vulnerable at a
          similar rate. <br /><br />
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries and
          re-shaping society. As the capacity for AI continues to expand, it is
          critical to recognize the role of diversity in driving innovation.
          Many organizations are signaling the need for inclusion in developing
          effective and ethical AI-based solutions. The UNESCO Fostering Womenâ€™s
          Leadership Report notes that diversity in AI-leadership is an economic
          and strategic advantage. Inclusive leaders foster teams that
          demonstrate more creative problem-solving through multiple
          perspectives, giving those organizations a competitive advantage.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout my career as a microbiologist, academic and administrator I
          have contributed and responded to the development of technology-based
          solutions in my research, teaching, and post-secondary leadership
          through creativity and inclusivity. In this talk I will highlight the
          importance of addressing gaps in the development of technology, in
          particular AI by building diverse teams, leading in an inclusive
          environment, fostering creativity, and developing opportunities for
          future scientists and leaders.
