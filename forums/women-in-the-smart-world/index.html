        <h4>Inclusive IoT: Building a Smart World for Everyone</h4>
        <p>
          The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly transforming how we live,
          work, and interact with technology. Yet, as cities and systems become
          smarter, ensuring inclusivity, diversity, accessibility, and cultural
          relevance remains a critical challenge. This presentation explores how
          IoT can be designed with context-awareness—adapting to users'
          environments, cultural norms, and diversity—to serve different
          communities and bridge socio-economic gaps. <br /><br />
          Drawing on research in smart cities, environmental monitoring, and
          AI-enabled sensor networks, this talk will share inclusive projects
          ranging from a postpartum mental health app leveraging IoT and LLMs,
          to international methane emission detection frameworks, the SCIRA
          smart city initiative for interoperable urban systems, and a
          participatory air quality sensing that empowers citizens through
          IoT-enabled volunteer sensing. These case studies illustrate how
          multidisciplinary collaboration can create IoT ecosystems that are not
          only intelligent but also inclusive, equitable, and truly

          Leadership in Convergence: How Human-AI Partnerships and Ecosystem
          Thinking are Driving Global Robotics
        </h4>
        <p>
          The global expansion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in
          the robotics sector is frequently hindered by a critical bottleneck:
          the scarcity of localized, high-fidelity data required for robust
          algorithm training and validation. This presentation introduces
          'Ecosystem Leadership,' a novel framework that addresses this
          challenge by forging deep Human-AI partnerships. <br /><br />
          We present a case study demonstrating how, through this model, we
          leverage NVIDIA's Isaac Sim and OpenUSD platforms not merely as tools,
          but as collaborative 'AI Partners'. This partnership generates
          synthetic data that is both technically precise and culturally
          localized, effectively overcoming the data dilemma and enabling
          robotics SMEs to de-risk development, accelerate international market
          entry, and build foundational local trust. The talk concludes by
          arguing that this leadership model—defined by its human-centric focus,
          collaborative nature, and sustainable mindset—represents a powerful
          and effective approach often championed by women in technology. It
          provides a tangible blueprint for how we can lead the convergence of
          minds and disciplines to build a more inclusive and resilient
          intelligent future.

        <h4>A trajectory generation for an indoor space</h4>
        <p>
          Human mobility simulation and trajectory generation are critical for
          urban planning, transportation management, and privacy-preserving
          mobility analysis. While deep generative models, such as GANs and
          VAEs, can synthesize mobility data, they often fail to capture complex
          environmental constraints and diverse spatiotemporal patterns, thereby
          limiting the realism of pedestrian trajectory simulations. In this
          presentation, I will share a diffusion-based generative framework to
          adapt the U-Net architecture for noise prediction across diffusion
          timesteps and to incorporate indoor map and spatial density encoders
          to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal characteristics in indoor
          environments.

        <h4>AI and Education: From AI support to AI-human collaboration</h4>
        <p>
          AI has tremendous potential, but its greatest potential is not to do
          work for us, but with us. In this talk, we will dive into the area of
          AI and education and explore how AI can support learners and educators
          as well as work in partnership with them to improve learning and
          teaching. When building effective and smart learning environments that
          are inclusive and consider the needs of all learners, diverse
          perspectives are of utmost importance, particularly in the design and
          evaluation of the underlying AI approaches. In this talk, we will
          discuss how AI can help to consider each individual learner's needs by
          analyzing behavioral and other data from learners and educators to
          find characteristics of learners as well as behavior patterns that
          lead to success or failure. In addition, we will introduce several
          smart learning environments that consider such individual differences,
          provide personalized recommendations, and encourage learners and
          educators to reflect on their activities. We will start with learning
          environments that focus on supporting learners and/or educators
          through personalized recommendations and adaptive interfaces and then
          investigate smart learning environments that work together with
          learners or educators to better understand their needs and provide
          better personalization.

          Disciplines", together with discussions emerging from presentations of
          AI researchers yesterday, will highlight the leadership and
          perspectives of women who are shaping a more inclusive and equitable
          smart world. By sharing a window to various fields in emerging
          technologies and engineering, the panelists will share insights at
          various stages of their career journey and how they have shaped
          inclusive and systemic change in a smart world.
          <br /><br />
          Representing fields such as AI policy and development, digital health,
          education, urban innovation, and ethics, our panelists will explore
          how women's participation across disciplines strengthens human-AI
