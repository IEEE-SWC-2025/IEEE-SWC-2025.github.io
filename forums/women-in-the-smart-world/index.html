          This session highlights insights and research by women who are
          advancing human-AI collaboration in industry and academia that remove
          barriers to develop and create a more inclusive and equitable smart
          environment. Through interdisciplinary lenses of smart world
          applications—including technology, ethics, design, and social
          impact—presenters will explore topics such as inclusive algorithm
          development, AI data ecosystems in agriculture, community health,
          gender-aware smart infrastructure, and equitable access in education
          technologies. These papers showcase how diverse professional and
          academic perspectives and disciplines can converge to ensure that
          innovations are responsive to the needs of all individuals that
          benefit a smart world.

          Join us for a panel discussion on how diversity and gender equity
          shapes inclusive human-AI partnerships.
        </h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          As smart technologies become deeply embedded in how we live, work, and
          connect, it is essential that the design and deployment of these
          innovations reflect the diversity of the societies they serve. This
          panel discussion, which is aligned with the theme of this Congress
          "Convergence of Minds: Forging Human-AI Partnerships Across
          Disciplines", together with discussions emerging from presentations of
          AI researchers yesterday, will highlight the leadership and
          perspectives of women who are shaping a more inclusive and equitable
          smart world. By sharing a window to various fields in emerging
          technologies and engineering, the panelists will share insights at
          various stages of their career journey and how they have shaped
          inclusive and systemic change in a smart world.
          <br /><br />
          Representing fields such as AI policy and development, digital health,
          education, urban innovation, and ethics, our panelists will explore
          how women's participation across disciplines strengthens human-AI
          partnerships and ensures that emerging technologies are built with
          empathy, accessibility, and social impact in mind. By championing
          gender equity and intersectional inclusion, this discussion will show
          how women are advancing technologies that not only solve problems—but
          also uplift communities and drive systemic change.
