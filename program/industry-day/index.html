              and Technology Officer, The City of Calgary. Co-presented with The
              City of Calgary IT team
            </p>
            <p class="fs-6 fw-normal">
              The City of Calgary is leading the way in technological innovation
              for municipal services. In this keynote, Jan, joined by a team of
              City of Calgary IT engineers and Engineers-in-Training (EITs),
              will spotlight the City's advancements in leveraging emerging
              technologies to improve service delivery. The presentation will
              feature practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI),
              Calgary's award-winning Internet of Things (IoT) network, robotic
              process automation (RPA), and other state-of-the-art tools driving
              smart city initiatives. Key strategic frameworks, including
              Calgary's AI Strategy and Enterprise Data Strategy, will be
              highlighted to demonstrate the City's forward-thinking approach.
              The keynote will also underscore Calgary's sustained investment in
              digital infrastructure, notably its city-wide fibre optic network,
              which now stretches over 650 kilometers—enabling smart city
              capabilities and promoting digital equity across the city.

              Preparing for Intelligence: Everyone Wants It, Few Are Ready
            </p>
            <p class="fs-6">
              By <a href="#jamie-pompu">Jamie Pompu</a>, CIO of Tressl
            </p>
            <p class="fs-6">
              Abstract: Everyone is chasing AI. But the only way to real
              intelligence is through great data. Most infrastructure workflows
              are still running on emails, spreadsheets, and manual processes.
              Tressl challenges the idea that AI is the next big fix. The real
              opportunity is in what makes AI possible in the first place:
              structured, consistent, and actionable information. Before
              automation and intelligence comes clarity, and that is where most
              systems fall apart. For anyone building, managing, or modernizing
              infrastructure, this talk offers a grounded perspective on how to
              prepare for what is next. Less hype, more readiness.

              Martin's keynote will provide a comprehensive overview of
              Alberta's evolving cybersecurity landscape, emphasizing its
              critical importance to the province's digital resilience. It will
              highlight the growing threat of ransomware, phishing, APTs, and
              DoS attacks, along with recent incidents that underscore the
              urgency of robust defenses. Key threat actors—including
              nation-states, cybercriminals, hacktivists, and insiders—will be
              examined to contextualize Alberta's risk environment. The
              Government of Alberta's CyberAlberta program will be showcased for
              its strategic initiatives, partnerships, and measurable impact.
              The address will also explore the province's efforts to cultivate
              cybersecurity talent through education, training, and professional
              development, with a vision of positioning Alberta as a global hub
              for cyber excellence. The session will conclude with a call to
              action for collaborative innovation to strengthen Alberta's
              cybersecurity posture.
