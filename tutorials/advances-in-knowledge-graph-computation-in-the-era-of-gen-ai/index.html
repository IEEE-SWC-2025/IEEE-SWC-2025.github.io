          Join us in exploring knowledge graph computation in the era of
          generative AI
        </h1>
        <p class="fs-5">
          The goal of this tutorial talk is to motivate and give a comprehensive
          introduction to the essential concepts of graph-based knowledge
          representation and construction, methods in knowledge graph
          computation, higher-order knowledge relations with hypergraph, and
          roles of knowledge graphs in the wave of generative AI enhanced
          applications and beyond. Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide a framework
          for organizing, accessing, and deriving knowledge through the
          interplay of symbolic representing and deductive reasoning, and
          statistical (inductive) learning. KGs empower a wide range of
          intelligent applications across domains like healthcare, finance,
          transportation, education, service industry, and various science and
          technology domains.
          <br /><br />
          The intended audience in this talk includes researchers and
          practitioners who are new to KGs or are interested in incorporating
          KGs based approaches to leveraging domain specific applications from
          various perspectives. As such, we do not assume that audiences have
          specific expertise on knowledge graphs.
          <br /><br />
          Knowledge graph computation is a big topic in terms of the scopes of
          the domain dependent depth and breath. This talk focuses on some
          limited and fundamental issues along with briefly introducing the
          basic concepts in knowledge graphs.
          <br /><br />
          The talk focuses on the following research questions:
        </p>
        <ul class="fs-5">
          <li>
            How can semantic completeness and consistency be ensured within KGs?
          </li>
          <li>How to extract and build KGs from raw data?</li>
          <li>
            How to interplay symbolic representing and deductive reasoning with
            statistical (inductive) learning through the upper stream of KGs
            construction and down stream of KGs applications?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fs-5">

          He was Nortel research fellow and post-doctoral fellow from 1998 until
          2001 in University of Calgary and visiting professor in University of
          Iowa in US in 1997. His recent research and teaching areas primarily
          focus on the system analysis and dynamic modeling in heterogeneous
          cyber-physical-social interaction, and semantic computing enhanced
          cognitive computing and data analytics towards decentralized real-time
          control and monitoring systems, environmental and engineering
          computing systems, and smart eLearning systems. He serves IEEE SMC
          (Systems, Man, & Cybernetics Society) technical committee on
          computer-supported cooperative work in design, and program committees
          in various annual conferences in computing and information systems. He
          supervised post-doctoral fellow, graduate students' essay, projects,
