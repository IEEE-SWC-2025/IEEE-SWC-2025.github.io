          state-of-the-art technologies and tools of smart world, ranging from
          Artificial Intelligence to the Internet of Things, from Cybersecurity
          to Smart Education, to Renewable energy, to name a few, as well as
          facilitating hands-on practices for the participants. <br /><br />

          a seasoned professional, an aspiring student, an entrepreneur, or
          simply a person interested in advanced technologies, tutorials provide
          a place for them to gain new knowledge, share insights, understand
          challenges, and acquire experiences on the smart world. Moreover,
          tutorials should also promote meaningful connections and new
          collaborations amongst participants.
